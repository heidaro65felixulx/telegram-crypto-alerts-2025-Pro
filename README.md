Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a service like **telegram-crypto-alerts** integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

The core principle, however, remains the same: using Telegram as a user-friendly front-end to execute complex, automated strategies on exchange back-ends.

The entire process can be broken down into three main layers: **1. The User & Telegram Layer**, **2. The Bot Logic & Processing Layer**, and **3. The Exchange Integration Layer**.
